# Requires XEmacs 21.0-beta19 or greater and GNU Make 3.78 or greater.

# This is for packages that require specific XEmacs versions to run
# (generally a VERY VERY BAD thing).  If you think your package needs
# this please take another look at your code to see if you can make it
# version independent.  Right now the only package that uses this is
# Mule-UCS, lets try to keep it that way. SY

# To get this to work, in the package's Makefile:
#
#  include ../../Local.rules
#  CHECK_VERSION = $(XEMACS) -batch -no-autoloads -eval '(princ (emacs-version>= x y z))'
#  # 'x y z' represents the minimum XEmacs major and optional minor and patch versions
#  # this package runs on.
#  ifeq ($(shell $(CHECK_VERSION)),t)
#   [rest of normal package Makefile]
#  else
#   include ../../Version.rules
#   bad-version:
#           [what to do if not right XEmacs version, usually just echo
#            something to stdout]
#  endif

# For a working example look at ./mule-packages/mule-ucs/Makefile


# From here on it is just a list of targets that all point to the
# 'bad-version' target.
